Java in  Method.<br>
A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task.
It is similar to a function in other programming languages.<br>
You define a method once, and you can use (or "call") it multiple times.<br>
This helps avoid repetition, makes the code cleaner, and improves reusability.
