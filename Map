In Java, a Map is a part of the Collection Framework, but it doesn't directly extend the Collection interface
because it stores data differently — as key-value pairs.
A Map allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data where each piece of data (value) is associated with a unique key.
This makes it very useful when you want to quickly look up information based on a key.

📦 Key Characteristics of Map
Stores key-value pairs – Every value is associated with a unique key.
Keys are unique – No two keys can be the same.
Values can be duplicated – Multiple keys can have the same value.
Allows fast retrieval – Lookup is efficient.
Implementations may or may not be ordered depending on the class.

✅ Main Implementations of Map
Implementation	Description
HashMap	Stores key-value pairs with hashing. Fast, unordered, allows one null key and multiple null values.
LinkedHashMap	Maintains insertion order. Good when order matters.
TreeMap	Stores in sorted order by keys. Implemented as a red-black tree.
Hashtable	Synchronized version of HashMap. Legacy class.
ConcurrentHashMap	Thread-safe version optimized for concurrency.
