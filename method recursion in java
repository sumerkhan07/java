*Method recursion in java
Method recursion means method repeation.
where one method calling to itself or another Method is known as Method recursion.

TYPES OF METHOD IN JAVA 
1.Direct method 
2.Indirect Method 

1-- Direct Recursion
A method is calling it self it known as direct recursion.
In direct recursion the calling method and called method is same.


class directMethod{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Main  method start");
		num(10);//method calling statement 
		System.out.println("Main method end");
	}
	public static void num(int n){
		System.out.println("Er suemr khan");
		System.out.println(n);//In direct recursion method calling and mthod called are same
		num(n);//recrsive call statement
	}
}

Problem in the Code: Infinite Recursion
The method num(n) calls itself again and again without any stopping condition (no if or return to stop it).
This is called infinite recursion.
Eventually, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will run out of stack memory and throw a:

2.Indirect recursion 
Two or morw method calling each other is known as Indirect method recursion.

eg 
class idc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        m2();
    }

    public static void indiRec() {
        System.out.println("HEllO ER");
        m2(); // keeps calling m2
    }

    public static void m2() {
        System.out.println("I am from m2");
        indiRec(); // keeps calling indiRec
    }
}
