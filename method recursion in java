*Method recursion in java
Method recursion means  method calling to itself or another Method is known as Method recursion.

TYPES OF METHOD IN JAVA 
1.Direct method 
2.Indirect Method 

1-- Direct Recursion
A method is calling it self it known as direct recursion.
In direct recursion the calling method and called method is same.


class directMethod{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Main  method start");
		num(10);//method calling statement 
		System.out.println("Main method end");
	}
	public static void num(int n){
		System.out.println("Er suemr khan");
		System.out.println(n);//In direct recursion method calling and mthod called are same
		num(n);//recrsive call statement
	}
}

Problem in the Code: Infinite Recursion

The method num(n) calls itself again and again without any stopping condition (no if or return to stop it).
This is called infinite recursion.
Eventually, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will run out of stack memory and throw a:
